simple weather application, pulls data from MetOffice data centre

IMPORTANT:

The program requires your own api key, which can be acquired by registering with the MetOffice Data Centre at this link:
https://register.metoffice.gov.uk/WaveRegistrationClient/public/register.do?service=datapoint

To use the app, make a notepad file and click [Save As] and call the file '.env'

In the file, type the following:

api_key = [your_api_key]

Replace [your_api_key] with the API key that you got from Datapoint

Note: I am aware that it's slow and will work on it in the future
